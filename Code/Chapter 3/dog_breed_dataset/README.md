# Dog Breed Dataset

This folder contains a file called `download.sh`. This shell script will download 100 images of the "Golden Retriever", "Husky", and "Labrador" dog breeds.

It uses a utility called [google-images-download](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download). Please install it before running the shell script.

Once the script is done running, you should have 3 zip files in this directory:

1. `goldenretriever.zip`
1. `husky.zip`
1. `labrador.zip`
